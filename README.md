Hello! This is my implementation of doing text summarization of BBC news dataset using transformers from Hugging face library. 
I am fine-tuning BART for text summarization using Pytorch.
Next, i am monitoring training progress using weights and biases library.
I am also evaluating the model using ROGUE library. 
I completed this project on the Educative platform and i have attached my certificate below.
