Hello! This is my implementation of text summarization of news articles using BART from Facebook, imported from the Hugging Face library. 
Next, I am monitoring training progress using the weights and biases library.
I am also evaluating the model using the ROGUE library. 

Iâ€™ll use the Hugging Face Hub API for access to the models, the PyTorch library for implementing the deep learning logic, the Weights & Biases library to visualize training, and the Evaluate library to evaluate the model.

Technologies uses:
Python, Pytorch and Hugging face library.
If there is any feedback, please let me know!
